    <h1>CSS Pseudo-Classess</h1>
    <p>A pseudo-class is a keyword added to a CSS selector, prefixed by a colon (:), to define a specific state or
        condition of an element. It is used to style elements like a hovered button, the first child of a container, or
        checked input fields.</p>
    <h1>CSS &colon; hover Selector</h1>
    <p>The CSS :hover selector is used for creating interactive and responsive designs. It allows you to apply styles to
        an element when the mouse pointer hovers over it. This effect is commonly used for buttons, links, images, and
        other UI elements, enabling you to enhance user experience through visual feedback.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax &colon;</h3>
    <pre>element :hover{
        // CSS declarations;
    }</pre>

    <h1>CSS &colon; active Selector</h1>
    <p>The: active selector is used in styling an active link of the web page. Style display when the user clicks on the
        link. This selector is different from :link, :visited and: hover selectors. The main use of : active selector is
        on the links but it can be used on all elements.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax &colon;</h3>
    <pre>:active{
        //CSS property
    }</pre>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h1>CSS &colon; link Selector</h1>
    <p>The :link is used to target the unvisited link for styling not the links which is already visited. For styling on
        visited use “:visited“, for styling on click use “:active” and for styling move mouse on link use “:hover”.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax &colon;</h3>
    <pre>:link {
        //property
    }</pre>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h1>CSS &colon; visited Selector</h1>
    <p>The :visited selector in CSS is used to select the visited links. For example, visit some link on the website and
        again see it, then it will find the changed color of that link. This color change is done by :visited the
        selector.</p>
    <p>The allowed CSS property of : visited selectors are listed below: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>color</li>
        <li>border-color</li>
        <li>backgroud-color</li>
        <li>outline-color</li>
        <li>column-rule-color</li>
        <li>fill-color and stroke</li>
    </ul>

            // CSS Properties
        }</pre>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h1>CSS &colon; focus Selector</h1>
    <p>The :focus CSS pseudo-class Selector is used to target the focused element ie., it selects an element that is
        currently focused by the user. This selector works on user input elements, generally used in forms, and is
        triggered as soon as the user clicks on it or taps on an element, or selects any keyboard events.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax &colon;</h3>
    <pre>:focus {
            // CSS property
     }</pre>

    <h1>CSS &colon; disabled Selector</h1>
    <p>The: disabled selector is used to select the disabled element. This property is mostly used on the form elements.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax &colon;</h3>
    <pre>:disabled {
        // CSS property
    }</pre>
    <br>
    <p>You can also Set a background color for all disabled input elements of type=”text or email or password”:</p>
    <pre>input[type=text / email / password]:disabled {
                background: #dddddd;
    }</pre>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h1>CSS &colon; enabled Selector</h1>
    <p>The :enabled selector is used to set the background color in enabled element in a form.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax &colon;</h3>
    <pre>:enabled {
        //property
      }</pre>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h1>CSS &colon; first-child Selector</h1>
    <p>CSS :first-child selector is used to select the elements that are the first child of the parent element.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax &colon;</h3>
    <pre>:first-child {
        /* CSS property */
  }</pre>
    <br>

    <hr>
    <br>
    <h1>CSS &colon; last-Child Selector</h1>
    <p>The CSS :last-child selector targets the last child element within its parent. It applies styles exclusively to
        the last child based on its position within the parent container, regardless of the element type or class. If
        the parent element is missing or incorrectly structured, the selector will not function as intended, because
        there is no defined parent-child relationship to reference.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax &colon;</h3>
    <pre>:last-child {
        //property
    }</pre>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <h1>CSS &colon; nth-Child() Selector</h1>
    <p>The :nth-child() pseudo-class selector targets elements based on their position among siblings, making it ideal
        for dynamic styling. It can select elements using specific positions (e.g., first, odd, or even), or patterns
        like An+B. This flexible CSS tool improves web design by simplifying how you apply styles to elements in lists,
        tables, or repetitive structures.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax &colon;</h3>
    <pre>:nth-child(number) {
        // CSS Property
    }</pre>
    <p>Where,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>number: This represents the pattern for matching elements. It can be a specific number, odd, even, or a
            formula like An+B, where A defines the step size and B is an offset.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>odd: Targets elements at odd positions (1, 3, 5, etc.) within their parent container.</li>
            <li>even: Targets elements at even positions (2, 4, 6, etc.) among their siblings.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Functional Notation (An+B): Matches elements whose positions follow the pattern An+B. Here, A is the
            interval (step size) and B is the offset.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>CSS &colon; nth-last-child() Selector</h1>
    <p>The nth-last-child() selector in CSS is used for selecting elements based on their position among sibling
        elements, but starting the count from the end rather than the beginning. This selector is particularly useful
        for styling elements dynamically based on their order in reverse, allowing for flexible and responsive design
        solutions. Understanding how to effectively use the nth-last-child() selector can enhance your CSS skills and
        enable more precise control over the styling of your web pages.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Syntax and Usage</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The nth-last-child() selector takes a single argument that determines the pattern for matching elements from the
        end. This argument can be a number, keyword (odd or even), or a functional notation.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax &colon;</h3>
    <br>
    <pre>:nth-last-child(number) { 
        //CSS Property }</pre>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>number: The argument that specifies the pattern for matching elements. It can be a specific number, odd,
            even, or a functional notation like An+B.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Keywords &colon;</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>odd: Selects elements whose positions are odd numbers counting from the end (1, 3, 5, etc.).</li>
        <li>even: Selects elements whose positions are even numbers counting from the end (2, 4, 6, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Functional Nation &colon;</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>An+B: Selects elements whose position matches the pattern An+B from the end, where A and B are integers. For
            every positive integer or zero value of n, the position of elements is determined.</li>
    </ul>
